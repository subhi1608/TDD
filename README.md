# Test Driven Development in nodejs using jest

## Overview

The **TDD** project provides a function `add` that calculates the sum of numbers from a string input. It supports custom delimiters specified at the beginning of the input string and handles various delimiters such as commas, semicolons, pipes, and newlines. The function also includes error handling for negative numbers, throwing detailed exceptions if negative numbers are found.
